# 🐍 Python Assignment – Control Structures (Module 3)

Welcome to my Python mini project!  
This repository includes two simple Python programs that are part of **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**.

These tasks helped me practice using:
- `if-else` statements
- `for` loops
- Basic user input
- Simple arithmetic

---

## ✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**File Name:** `even_odd.py`

### 💡 What This Program Does:
- Asks the user to enter a number
- Checks whether the number is **even** or **odd**
- Shows the result using an `if-else` condition

### 🧪 Example Output:
Enter an integer: 8

8 is an even number.
